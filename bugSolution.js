The solution involves avoiding the use of `@apply` in dynamically rendered parts of the application. Instead, define CSS classes directly or use a different utility to manage styles conditionally.  Here's an example using plain Tailwind classes instead of `@apply`:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
function MyComponent({ showButton }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {showButton && (
        <button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
          Click Me
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This approach ensures that the styles are applied correctly, as they are defined directly using Tailwind's class names, removing the reliance on `@apply` within dynamic components.
