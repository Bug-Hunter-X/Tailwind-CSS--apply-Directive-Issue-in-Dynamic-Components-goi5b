This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, and it is related to how Tailwind's `@apply` directive is processed.  The error typically manifests when `@apply` is used within a component that's dynamically generated or conditionally rendered.  The problem is that Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) engine might not process the `@apply` directive correctly if it's encountered during runtime instead of build time, resulting in classes not being applied correctly or unexpected CSS behavior.
